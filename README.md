# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration-A-User-Friendly-Tool-Using-Streamlit-and-Plotly

 This project aims to clone data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and to transform the extracted data into a suitable format to perform any pre-processing steps and then insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval and finally Creating a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python that will provide valuable insights and information about the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

## Data Extraction:
The first step is to clone the Phonepe pulse Github repository which contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics.

## Data Transformation:
Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary preprocessing steps using Python and Pandas.

## Database Insertion: 
Store the transformed data in a MySQL database using mysql-connector-python for efficient storage and retrieval.

## Dashboard Creation:
Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

## Data Retrieval:
Fetch data from the MySQL database to update the dashboard.

## User Interaction:
Provide dropdown options for different data visualizations.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, do the following steps:

1. Clone this repository "https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse.git".
